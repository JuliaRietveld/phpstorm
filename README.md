# PhpStorm Cheat Sheet

This repository provides links to various PhpStorm resources, including the custom [color scheme](KnowTheCode.icls) and code styles that I use.

## Installation

- Local Development Setup for [Mac](https://knowthecode.io/labs/local-development-environment-setup-mac/phpstorm-installation) or [Windows](https://knowthecode.io/labs/local-development-environment-setup-windows/phpstorm-installation)

## Color Schemes - The Look

Like everything in PhpStorm, the color scheme and visual styling of the IDE is completely customizable.  Take the time to adjust the font type and size, line spacing, and color schemes.  Remember, you work in this tool all day long.  A poorly designed visual environment can lead to eye fatigue.  Take the time to tweak it to a styling that appeals to you.

- My [color scheme](KnowTheCode.icls)
- Dayle Rees' themes are an awesome resource to get you started:
    - [Examples site](http://daylerees.github.io/)
    - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes)
    
To install a color scheme, go to `Preferences > Editor > Color Scheme`. Then click on the cog icon and select `Import Scheme`.

## Keymappings

Keymappings are configurable.  You will want to take the time to customize each of the repetitive tasks you do in order to increase your productivity by keeping your hands on the keyboard.
